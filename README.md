## notofox.so
### Notofox is the SaaS solution I am currently building that lets startups create a feedback portal to receive feedback from their users. 
### Startups embded our feedback widget to collect user feedback inside their app, all collected feedback is sent to a Notion template. You can then share the Notion template with your team so everyone can review the user feedback as it's received in real time

## footprint.so
### Footprint is another SaaS solution I'm *planning* to build. To understand what the software does, look at the questions below: 

### Do you have a Netflix subscription? Do you have a Google account? Are your passwords for your Netflix and Google acocunt the same? 
### Chance are they probably are. 90% of consumers use the same password for every website they sign up for, this is a huge problem because if one website leaks your password in a data breach, now all your services are at risk since you used the same password. 

### To address this problem, I want to build a service that connects to your email inbox and shows you your entire digital footprint- a grid of all the services you have ever registered for using that email address. You'll be able to "reclaim" your data from any service by submitting a data deletion request in compliance with GDPR laws.
