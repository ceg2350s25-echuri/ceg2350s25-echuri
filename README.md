## notofox.so
### Notofox is the SaaS solution I am currently building that lets startups create a feedback portal to receive feedback from their users. 
### Startups embed our feedback widget to collect user feedback inside their app, all collected feedback is sent to a Notion template. You can then share the Notion template with your team so everyone can review the user feedback as it's received in real time

## footprint.so
### Footprint is another SaaS solution I'm *planning* to build. To understand what the software does, look at the questions below: 

### Do you have a Netflix subscription? Do you have a Google account? Are your passwords for your Netflix and Google account the same? 
### Chances are they probably are. 90% of consumers use the same password for every website they sign up for, this is a huge problem because if one website compromises your password in a data breach, all of your services are at risk since you've used the same password. 

### To address this problem, I want to build a service that connects to your email inbox using OAuth and shows you your entire digital footprint- a grid of all the services you have ever registered for using that email address. You'll be able to "reclaim" your data from any service by submitting a data deletion request in compliance with GDPR laws. If any services you use are compromised in a data breach, your eamil address will be checked for in the data breach dump. If it's found then the user will be notified that they have been compromised and which service is responsible for leaking their information. 

[Work in Progress Example]
